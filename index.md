**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  

The most interesting topic we covered in our meetings so far, to me, was catastrophe modeling.
When performing catastrophe modeling, there are four main steps: Hazard, Vulnerability, Exposure, and Loss. Step one, hazard, determine the hazard, which is the combination of event intensity, duration, and frequency of occurrence (IDF). Step two, vulnerability, establishes the impact the severity of the hazard will have on the natural or built environment based on how sensitive and vulnerable it is. Step three, exposure, get the location and type of asset to join with the local hazard and appropriate impact function. Step four, loss, compute the loss and damage metrics of an asset.


**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  

What contributes to the intensity and severity of fires? More specifically, how much effect does each factor contribute to it? Is there one specific factor that contributes the most to the intensity and severity of a fire, or is it an equal impact from multiple factors?


**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  

We have not made much progress in our Quarter 1 Project yet, as we have only gotten the initial instructions and steps recently. So, I'm not sure what a potential change I would make to the approach taken in our Quarter 1 Project.


**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  

I am interested in using spatial analysis techniques, such as using GIS data, for our project. Our mentors already asked us to download QGIS and have talked about GIS data throughout our meetings so far, so I know we will be using GIS. I am interested in using it throughout the capstone and becoming more knowledgeable about it by the end of the capstone.
